    <h2>introduction to Neuroscience and Brain Function</h2>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;We encourage students to use the “Three-Step Method” for support in their learning. Please find our
        version of
        the Three-Step Method, created in collaboration with Queen’s Student Academic Success Services.The human brain
        is responsible for all behaviors, thoughts, and experiences described in this textbook. This module provides an
        introductory overview of the brain, including some basic neuroanatomy, and brief descriptions of the
        neuroscience methods used to study it.</p>

    <p>
        Any textbook on psychology would be incomplete without reference to the brain. Every behavior, thought, or
        experience described in the other modules must be implemented in the brain. A detailed understanding of the
        human brain can help us make sense of human experience and behavior. For example, one well-established fact
        about human cognition is that it is limited. We cannot do two complex tasks at once: We cannot read and carry on
        a conversation at the same time, text and drive, or surf the Internet while listening to a lecture, at least not
        successfully or safely. We cannot even pat our head and rub our stomach at the same time (with exceptions, see
        section “A Brain Divided” below).

    <h3>Neuroplasticity: How the Brain Adapts and Changes</h3>

    <p>The brain is the key organ of stress reactivity, coping, and recovery processes. Within the brain, a distributed
        neural circuitry determines what is threatening and thus stressful to the individual. Instrumental brain systems
        of this circuitry include the hippocampus, amygdala, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. Together, these systems
        regulate physiological and behavioral stress processes,</p>

    <p>
        which can be adaptive in the short-term and maladaptive in the long-term. Importantly, such stress processes
        arise from bidirectional patterns of communication between the brain and the autonomic, cardiovascular, and
        immune systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms underpinning cognition, experience, and behavior. In one
        respect, these bidirectional stress mechanisms are protective in that they promote short-term adaptation
        (allostasis). In another respect, however, these stress mechanisms can lead to a long-term dysregulation of
        allostasis in that they promote maladaptive wear-and-tear on the body and brain under chronically stressful
        conditions (allostatic load), compromising stress resiliency and health.

    <h3>Mental Health: overview of Mental Health and Its Importance</h3>

    <p>
        Mental health awareness has gained significant traction in recent years, and for good reason. Mental illnesses,
        such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, affect millions of people worldwide, with the World Health
        Organization (WHO) estimating that around 1 in 4 people will experience mental health issues at some point in
        their lives. Despite this prevalence,
    </p>
    <p>
        Raising awareness about mental health is crucial because it fosters understanding, reduces stigma, and
        encourages people to seek help. It also helps in identifying the causes and symptoms of mental illness, which is
        essential for early intervention and treatment.
